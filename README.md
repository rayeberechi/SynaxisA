## Contribution Guidelines  

### Branching  
- Everyone should clone the repo and work on their local machine.  
- Push changes to a **new branch** (not directly to `main`).  
- Your branch name should reference your name and the section you are working on e.g `Faith-TechStack`.  
- When satisfied with your changes, create a **Pull Request (PR)** for review.    

### Commits  
- Use clear commit messages:  
  - `feat: added navbar`  
  - `fix: corrected color in hero section`  
  - `docs: updated readme`  

### Pull Requests  
- Always create PRs into `main`.  

### Assets  
- Place all images and logo files directly in `/assets/`  
- Name assets to be descriptive `faith-pfpic.jpg`, `SynaxisA-logo-light-theme.png`
